# az-terraform
Terraform activities in azure

Getting used to terraform, will be writing code that originated as az cli commands and seeing where I end up.

Registering provider with the version parameter works - baby steps

Resource group create works - like I said this is learning to crawl

Both "DisplayName" and "Name" are valid for the location - will stick with Name from here on out.
Hoping to remember to use the tags for cool stuff later on.

Review this link at some point to see if there's value - still want a good assistant for VSCode and terraform

Storage accounts must be unique! adding code for that
